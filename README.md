# gpu_setup

- `install-gpu.sh` sets up a working server 
- `install-fastai.sh` sets up fastai workspace

Be sure to install in this order. Anaconda is loaded in `install-gpu.sh` and sets up the `fastai` conda env. Before using `install-fastai.sh`, be sure that `conda activate fastai` has been executed so as to be in the correct environment.
